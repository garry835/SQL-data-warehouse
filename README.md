SQL Data Warehouse: An End-to-End Architecture Using SQL Server
This project showcases the design and implementation of a data warehouse using Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), focusing on the core principles of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). It illustrates how raw data can be systematically transformed into clean, structured, and business-ready information, following a multi-layered architecture inspired by modern data engineering practices.

🚦 Purpose
The objective of this data warehouse is to demonstrate how raw, unstructured data can be converted into high-quality analytical datasets that align with specific business requirements. The setup includes ETL workflows, data modeling, data cleansing, and analytics-ready views—all within a well-organized and layered SQL Server environment.

🏗️ Layered Architecture
The warehouse follows a three-tier architecture, which ensures separation of concerns, reusability, and traceability across the data lifecycle:

1. Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion
Purpose: Serves as the staging area for raw data.

Process: Performs a full load of data directly from source datasets into corresponding SQL tables.

Operation: No transformations are applied at this stage—data is ingested as-is.

Goal: Preserve the original data in its raw form for auditability and rollback.

2. Silver Layer – Data Transformation
Purpose: Focuses on cleaning, transforming, and standardizing the raw data.

Techniques Used:

Data cleansing (handling nulls, fixing formats)

Standardization (consistent naming, data types)

Casting & conversions (ensuring type safety and integrity)

Enrichment (adding business-relevant attributes)

Goal: Make the data more usable and consistent across sources.

3. Gold Layer – Business-Focused Aggregation
Purpose: Provides final, analytics-ready data in the form of views or aggregated tables.

Process:

Data integration across multiple silver tables

Business logic application (KPIs, metrics)

Aggregation and summarization

Goal: Enable dashboarding, reporting, and analytics in line with organizational needs.

📂 Repository Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

📁 Datasets:
Contains all the raw data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) used for ingestion into the bronze layer.

📁 Docs:
Provides documentation to help understand the purpose of each layer, key transformations, and overall pipeline design.

📁 Scripts:
Includes SQL scripts categorized by layer:

DDL scripts for table/view creation

ETL logic for Bronze → Silver → Gold transitions

📁 Tests:
Contains validation SQL scripts to check:

Null handling

Referential integrity

Data type conformity

Business rule correctness in both Silver and Gold layers

🧠 Summary
This project acts as a miniature replica of how enterprises structure data for efficient business use. It highlights the importance of organizing data in layers, maintaining data quality, and aligning with business logic for reliable insights.

While data warehouses are one of the popular approaches to manage structured data, they differ from data lakes which are more flexible with unstructured data. This warehouse exemplifies a SQL-driven approach that is scalable, maintainable, and production-ready in a real-world enterprise setup.
